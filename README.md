# Ganar CRM Demo & Tutorial
### This is a text tutorial of Django 3 (DRF) with Vue3 CLI combined.

Original Tutorial is [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rxHWX730nE&list=PLpyspNLjzwBl-u7Vh8mGfqqRKcVxHzqlp&index=2) (Made by Code With Stein (`Subscribe to him, he is awesome`))

**I'm making this for myself for the future, and for more practice.
and maybe someone will find a text version faster (Steins videos are fast enough in my opinion)**

*Some of the code will be on pastebin / you will get refference to the video to save space in this document*

The tutorial is split into a few parts, each part will explain each video in text.
